**How do I approach designing software?**
Approaching software design, I will use a stratgic method by starting with understanding the problem domain and user requirements. 
I found is effective when I need to break down the system into modular compenents, defining clear responsibilites for each, and use diagrams
to map out requirments. In addition to priortize clarity, scalability, and maintainability with any projects.
Along the way, I developed a intermediate sense of how to structure graphical components and how to balance errors with expected outcome.
I had to learn CRITICAL thinking about user interaction, expectation, and scene composition. I followed an iterative design process include:
planning (define the scene's goals and listed required features), sketching (create rough layouts of the scene and object placements), 
refinement (gradually added textures, lighting, and interactivity) and incorportate feedback & testing (evaluate the scene's usability and
visual appeal, then make the adjustments.


**How do I approach developing programs?**
Approaching development programs may seemed intimidating but I used some skills in modular and iterative tactics, outlining a break down 
complex visuals into manageable components and refining through feedback.  Whether its a game development or actual data visualization, 
effective and strategic implementations with help maintain clarity and adaptability. Focusing on structure and clarity, I will outline the 
program's logic, then execute the features. I will test as much as possible to make sure, during code execution, that bugs and simple syntax
errors are corrected and comments are added. Iteration played a major part of my contruction and execution of the my code.  Overtime, I became 
more discipline in planning my coding. Learning to anticipate edge cases (complicated), write reusable functions, and document my work as best
as I can. Overall debugging skills improved and I became alot more comfortable using the libraries  and tools to enhance functionality.



**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
This course equipped me with more effective problem-solving skills, logical thinking (common sense), and technical proficiency. Whether I use
these skills to progress in software engineering, automation, or research, this course provides the foundation to build innovative
solutions and adapt to evolving technologies. Computational graphics and visualizations  provided a deep understanding to rendering techniques and in 
some form of linear alegbra. The skills enhanced my ability to model complex systems. In addition to my future professional pathway, it has improved
my create intuitive, engagement interfaces and visual representations of data or environments.
